# Ayo Ogunade
As a Software-driven student, I am eagerly seeking a Software Development internship for the summer of 2025 to leverage my expertise in Java, Python, C, and Excel as well as building a Software Developing foundation on a higher level. My aspirations revolve around a career in Software Development, with a particular focus on crafting educational apps tailored for secondary and college-level content, aimed at making learning accessible to students worldwide.
