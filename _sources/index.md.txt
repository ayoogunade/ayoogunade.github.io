# About Me

üëã Hi, I'm Ayo Ogunade, a second-year Computer Science student passionate about Software Development, AI, and Machine Learning. I'm currently seeking a Software Development internship for summer 2025, where I can apply my knowledge in Java, Python, and C to create impactful solutions. I'm particularly interested in building **educational apps** to make learning accessible for students around the world.

Outside of my studies and work, I actively engage with organizations like the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) and Sankofatech's Achievers in Technology (AIT) program.
